# leaflet-challenge

This repository contains the html, css and javascript for the leaflet challenge.

The website has been deployed at: https://mford80.github.io/leaflet-challenge/

This website provides all the functionality required in Leaflet Part 1 of the challenge.
In addition it has the capacity to change the basemap and add/remove the Earthquake layer as required in Leaflet Part 2.

Note that all the code has been uploaded to the repository in a single "Leaflet" folder.
Note also that while the challenge was largely addressed using javascript (ie. the 'logic.js' file), the provided css and html files have also been edited.
